          <p style="font-size: 16px;">You might be wondering Why, When, How of this gesture but let's just leave it at "<strong style="color:var(--color-primary);">I care about you</strong>", for now.
            <br>Even if you don't give a crap about me I just can't change how much care about you. I have tried ignoring you, I have tried hating you, I have tried to focus my attention somewhere else too, but I just can't.
            <br>
            <br>Oh you are confused about what I said above? Let me explain.
            <br>See, I know you hide your status/stories from me, I know you unfollowed me and also removed me from your followers within a month after we connected on insta. (If it was a mistake you could just reconnect, but you kept replying to my messages on insta instead???)
            Also when I was in Jaipur I chatted with you for a min and asked you If you are okay? In reply you did not even ask me If I am okay (Girl I am the one far from home, I was injured, still have the pain.) All of these things and some other things hurt me, I am not good at making it visible to you.
            <br>.<br>.<br>.
            <br>Actually forget all the above crap. You know why I am hurt by this right?
            <br>
            <br>It is because <strong>I Love you Akansha</strong>.
            <br>I have always loved you, even when we were kids. The earlist I remember having these feelings for you is from ~2010 
            <br>Back then we were on the path of becoming very good friends and I loved that feeling and since then I have just wanted to be around you, see you, hear you, talk to you, just be with you.
            <br>I know this is a big thing but I am sure that you had some idea about this before, Even I have felt that you also liked me before (I am foolish, See you didn't even replied to my Happy Birthday message, you don't give a crap but I will still continue)
            <br>
            <br>Anyways don't stress about this, these are my feelings and I will deal with them till my last breathe, probably. 
            <br>But I feel like I had to tell you this because I don't want to die knowing that I did not even try to express my feelings to you and also it just hurts soo much everytime you call me bhaiya I literally want to kill myself everyday.
            <br>
            <br>P.S.
            <br>I am not finally saying all this because your father is looking for a boy. I was gonna tell you on 4th October, but on that day I heard about this rishta situation and that you were sad and not eating and I did not want to cause any more stress when I should be supportive.
            <br>
            <br>I guess this is all from my side. I don't know what I or you should do but I would love to be with you forever and ever. If you want to talk about this or aything else I am always there just give me a call but don't stress about it Again it's my feelings. But <strong style="color:var(--color-primary);">it would really help</strong> if you could stop calling me bhaiya.
